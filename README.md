# Dev Ops Speech to Text

The Dev Ops Speech to Text, dost, this project aims to execute command line interfaces from voice to help aid in the process of dev ops.

One of the goals is to convert the commands into more user friendly commands.\
Ex. cd <FOLDER> = change directory to <FOLDER>\
Ex. az costmanagement export <...> = az costmanagement export <...>\

## Challenges in this project

Another challenge would be separating out windows and linux commands.
